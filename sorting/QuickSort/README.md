# QuickSort

:arrow_right: key process is **_`partition()`_**. <br />
:arrow_right: Divide/partition step does all the heavy lifting, combine step does absolutely nothing.<br />
:arrow_right: Works in place And worst-case running time is as bad as selection sort's and insertion sort's: **`O(n^2)`**.
:arrow_right: Outperforms selection sort, insertion sort and merge sort in practice.

### Complexity:
 - Time complexity(Average and Best case) - **`O(nlog n)`**
 - Time complexity(Worst case) - **`O(n^2)`**
 - Space complexity - **`O(1)`**
