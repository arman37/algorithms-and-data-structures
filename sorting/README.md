# Sorting Algorithms

### Notes
* Bubble sort takes **_`n^2/2`_** comparisons and **_`n^2/2`_** swaps (inversions) in both average case and in worst case.
* Selection sort takes **_`n^2/2`_** comparisons and **_`n`_** swaps.
* Insertion sort takes **_`n^2/4`_** comparisons and **_`n^2/8`_** swaps in average case and in the worst case they are double.
* Insertion sort is almost linear for partially sorted input.
* Selection sort is best suits for elements with bigger values and small keys.
