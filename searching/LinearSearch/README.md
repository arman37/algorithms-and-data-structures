# Linear Search

### Complexity:
 - Time complexity - **`O(n)`**
 - Space complexity - **`O(1)`**

### Pros:
* Efficient when data is less and unordered.
* Simple, very easy to understand and implement.
* Memory efficient since its space complexity is `O(1)`.
* The data in the collection doesn't have to be in a particular order.

### Cons:
* Slower than most other forms of searching algorithms.
* Inefficient since its average and worst time complexity is `O(n)`, if the collection being searched contains 100,000 integer value, the linear search algorithm will have to look at all 100,000 elements in order to find a value in the last element.
* Scales linearly.
