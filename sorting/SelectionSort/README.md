# Selection Sort

:arrow_right: Sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. <br />
:arrow_right: To find the minimum element from the array of  elements, (**`N - 1`**) comparisons are required. Therefore **_`(N - 1) + (N - 2) + ...... + 1 = (N.(N - 1))/2`_** comparisons and **N** swaps result in the overall complexity of **`O(n^2)`**<br />

### Complexity:
 - Time complexity - **`O(n^2)`**
 - Space complexity - **`O(1)`**
